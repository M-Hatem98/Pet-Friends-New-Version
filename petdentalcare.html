                <h3>DENTAL CARE FOR PETS</h3>
                <p>Taking care of your pet's dental health is crucial. If your dog or cat experiences mouth pain, struggles with chewing or swallowing, it's important to schedule a visit to the veterinarian. Signs of inadequate dental care include foul breath, gum disease, and tooth loss. Ensuring proper dental care for your pets at home is vital for their overall well-being and happiness.</p>
                <h3>When is it worth contacting a vet dentist?</h3>
                <p>If you notice a foul odor or a significant buildup of tartar on your pet's teeth, it's time to schedule an appointment with a dentist. Contact a veterinarian immediately if you have a pet suffering from dental problems, such as tooth swelling or decay. Make sure they are eating well and sleeping well so that there is no pain during their visit to the veterinarian's office and afterwards when they return home.</p>
                <h3>Cats and dogs commonly experience dental issues.</h3>
                <p>Taking care of your pets' teeth is crucial for their overall well-being. Regular dental check-ups are necessary to detect oral infections, broken teeth, foul breath, and other indications of oral diseases. Dogs should be taken to the veterinarian every six months, while cats should be seen every three months or more frequently if any symptoms indicate a problem.</p>
                <p>The following are additional symptoms and issues that indicate the necessity of a dental examination for cats and dogs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty Eating or Chewing</li>
                    <li>Excessive Drooling</li>
                    <li>Pawing at the Mouth</li>
                    <li>Swollen or Bleeding Gums</li>
                    <li>Loose or Missing Teeth</li>
                    <li>Change in Behavior</li>
                    <li>Bad Breath</li>
                    <li>Tumors in the Gums</li>
                    <li>Discoloration of Teeth</li>
                    <li>Bleeding from the Mouth</li>  
                    <li>Difficulty in Picking Up Food</li>
                    <li>Nasal Discharge and Sneezing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A specialized veterinary dentist will examine your pet's oral cavity for any signs of infection, such as redness in the gums (gingivitis), abscesses beneath the tongue (pericarditis), or swelling on one side of the head (sinusitis). X-rays may also be taken to identify any fractures in the mouth; in such cases, it is advisable not to delay treatment in the hopes that the situation will improve on its own, as there could be serious repercussions in the future.</p>
                <h3>Why is anesthesia necessary for dental procedures in pets?</h3>
                <p>Anesthesia is essential in dentistry for pets to ensure they do not experience any pain during treatment and surgery. Many dogs and cats are fearful of dental procedures, and anesthesia helps keep them calm and comfortable. It also prevents pets from moving around during surgery, making the process safer for both the animal and the veterinarian. Additionally, anesthesia is used to prevent pets from swallowing instruments due to pain or fear.</p>
                <h3>Why is regular veterinary dental care necessary?</h3>
                <p>Regular veterinary dental care is crucial for pets for various reasons. For instance, senior dogs and cats suffering from tooth decay and gum disease can benefit greatly from dental care to prevent further damage to their oral health. Moreover, regular dental cleanings can help prevent bad breath, which can be embarrassing for both pets and their owners. If you are concerned about the time commitment of regular vet visits, rest assured that we will work with your schedule to ensure that these appointments do not disrupt your daily routine.</p>
                <h3>Pet’s dental care at home</h3>
                <p>Taking care of your pet's dental health at home is crucial. It is recommended to brush your pet's teeth daily, preferably twice a day. If you have multiple pets of the same age, you can brush their teeth together in the same room.</p>
                <p>Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste specifically designed for dogs or cats. Make sure to use water while brushing to ensure effectiveness.</p>

                <h3>Visit to the veterinary dentist</h3>
                <p>A visit to a veterinary dental clinic to consult with a dog or cat dentist is the first step in ensuring the oral health of your pet. During the consultation, the animal dentist will evaluate the animal's oral condition and identify any problems such as tartar buildup or gum disease. Anesthesia is often necessary for procedures such as teeth cleaning for pets to ensure the animal's comfort and safety. However, pet owners should be aware of the risks, especially for older animals or those with underlying health conditions.</p>
                <p>The services provided at a veterinary dental clinic include:</p>
                <ul>

                <h3>FAQs</h3>
                <h4>What are the reasons behind dental issues in pets?</h4>
                <p>Dental problems in pets are typically caused by a mix of factors, including genetics, diet, and inadequate oral care. Just like humans, pets can develop plaque and tartar buildup, which can lead to gum disease and tooth decay if not addressed regularly. A diet high in sugary treats or lacking in nutrients that promote dental health can worsen these problems. Regular professional dental cleanings by a dog dentist or veterinary specialist are crucial for maintaining your pet’s oral health. These cleanings not only remove plaque and tartar but also help in early detection and treatment of potential dental issues, ensuring your pet's overall health.</p>
                <p>If your pet shows signs of bad breath or an unpleasant odor from its mouth, make sure to schedule checkups at least every six months (or more frequently if needed).</p>
                <h4>How often should dogs undergo dental cleanings by a vet?</h4>
                <p>The frequency of dental cleanings depends on your pet's age, health, and breed. If you are unsure about how often to have your dog's teeth checked, it is better to have them checked more frequently than not enough. Generally, dogs under two years old should have their teeth cleaned every four months, while older breeds may need annual visits. If your dog chews on hard toys or eats hard foods that can wear down their gums quickly, consider having them examined at least every six months for dental health reasons (and possibly more frequently).</p>
                <h4>What is the cost of a dog dentist?</h4>
                <p>The cost of a pet dental checkup varies based on the required procedures. Older pets may need more frequent visits than younger ones. You should also budget for services like scaling and polishing during dog dental cleaning. Pet owners should schedule regular checkups at least every six months to address any dental issues before they worsen and require surgery.</p>

                            FOOD DELIVERY Feeding your pets high quality food gives them a chance at a longer and healthier life. Like humans, pets also require essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Poor nutrition can have serious effects like obesity, allergies, fur loss, and emaciation. Unbalanced diets, especially during your pets’ growing phase, can result in detrimental health consequences. Indicators for poor nutrition you should look out for include bad breath, hair loss, dull coat, body odor, unusual bowel movements, and dandruff. At the Pet Friends we understand that cats and dogs are more than just pets, they are family. That is why we are devoted to supplying even the most discerning pet owners with a wide assortment of curated pet food, including organic and veterinary prescription diets. We also stock environmentally-friendly toys, training tools, treats, and grooming products. We carefully monitor pet food recalls and supply only the highest-grade goods. You can be certain, if it’s Pet Friends approved, it’s safe!

                            Skin-related issues are not limited to human beings and can plague animals too. Much like their owners, pets should also have regular visits to the dermatologist. Like us, pets can suffer from skin rashes, allergies, infections and other related issues, which can be aggravated by the hot climatic conditions. Since animals spend most of their time walking and lying down on the ground, their skin is more prone to contracting infections and to being aggravated. Skin conditions in pets should not be taken lightly because of the possibility of the disease being transmissible to you. Pet health can be beneficial to the overall health of your household. Our veterinary dermatologists are highly trained in treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in pets.
