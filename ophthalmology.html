                    <h3>Common Symptoms of Eye Diseases in Animals</h3>
                    <p>Some of the most frequently observed symptoms of eye diseases in animals are:</p>

                    </ul>
                   
                    <h3>Common Eye Diseases</h3>
                    <p>Eye diseases are common in animals and can range from infections to tumors. Some of the frequent eye diseases include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conjunctivitis: inflammation of the thin membrane covering the inner surface of the eyelid and part of the sclera</li>
                        <li>Keratitis: inflammation of the cornea</li>
                        <li>Glaucoma: increased intraocular pressure leading to optic nerve damage and vision loss</li>

                    <p>At our clinic, we utilize a range of advanced diagnostic techniques and surgical procedures to effectively treat eye diseases in animals.

                    <p>This branch of veterinary medicine plays a crucial role in maintaining the vision and overall health of our beloved pets. It is essential to seek prompt medical attention from a veterinarian if you observe any signs of eye problems in your animal.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What Conditions Does Veterinary Ophthalmology Treat?</h4>
                    <p>Veterinary ophthalmology treats a range of conditions including different types of cataracts, glaucoma, retinal atrophy, infectious and inflammatory eye diseases, and more.</p>
                   
                    <h4>What Is the Process for Visiting an Ophthalmologist?</h4>
                    <p>When visiting an ophthalmologist, the process typically begins with an examination of the animal's eyes and gathering medical history. The doctor may also perform additional tests such as measuring intraocular pressure, assessing the field of vision, conducting ultrasound examinations of the eyes, and others, depending on the diagnosis. Based on the findings, the doctor will prescribe a treatment plan which may involve medication therapy, surgical intervention, or laser therapy.</p>

In order to heal them, animals were treated using natural herbs. Until quite recently, herbal medicine had been in practice to treat everything from gut disorders to itchy skin and ear infections.

                            FOOD DELIVERY Feeding your pets high quality food gives them a chance at a longer and healthier life. Like humans, pets also require essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Poor nutrition can have serious effects like obesity, allergies, fur loss, and emaciation. Unbalanced diets, especially during your pets’ growing phase, can result in detrimental health consequences. Indicators for poor nutrition you should look out for include bad breath, hair loss, dull coat, body odor, unusual bowel movements, and dandruff. At the Pet Friends we understand that cats and dogs are more than just pets, they are family. That is why we are devoted to supplying even the most discerning pet owners with a wide assortment of curated pet food, including organic and veterinary prescription diets. We also stock environmentally-friendly toys, training tools, treats, and grooming products. We carefully monitor pet food recalls and supply only the highest-grade goods. You can be certain, if it’s Pet Friends approved, it’s safe!

                            Skin-related issues are not limited to human beings and can plague animals too. Much like their owners, pets should also have regular visits to the dermatologist. Like us, pets can suffer from skin rashes, allergies, infections and other related issues, which can be aggravated by the hot climatic conditions. Since animals spend most of their time walking and lying down on the ground, their skin is more prone to contracting infections and to being aggravated. Skin conditions in pets should not be taken lightly because of the possibility of the disease being transmissible to you. Pet health can be beneficial to the overall health of your household. Our veterinary dermatologists are highly trained in treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in pets.
