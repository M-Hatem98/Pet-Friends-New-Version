These practices are essential in maintaining your pet's overall well-being and preventing additional stressors to the heart, such as diseases and injuries.

However, it is important to note that medications for humans may not be suitable for animals due to differences in factors such as weight and body composition. Before trying any new medication for your pet, it is best to consult with your vet to discuss their recommendations and the appropriate dosage for your cat's health needs.</p>
              <h4>What are the most common heart diseases in cats?</h4>
              <p>The most common heart diseases in cats are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Cardiomyopathy: This disease weakens or slows down the muscles of the cat's heart.</li>
                <li>Heart failure: This condition occurs when a cat is unable to oxygenate their bloodstream properly, often due to lung or heart issues or excess fluid around the lungs (congestive heart failure).</li>
                <li>Valvular diseases like mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery stenosis: These conditions make it difficult for blood to flow through the cat's arteries, potentially leading to congestive heart failure if both issues are present.</li>
              </ul>

                        FOOD DELIVERY Feeding your pets high quality food gives them a chance at a longer and healthier life. Like humans, pets also require essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Poor nutrition can have serious effects like obesity, allergies, fur loss, and emaciation. Unbalanced diets, especially during your pets’ growing phase, can result in detrimental health consequences. Indicators for poor nutrition you should look out for include bad breath, hair loss, dull coat, body odor, unusual bowel movements, and dandruff. At the Pet Friends we understand that cats and dogs are more than just pets, they are family. That is why we are devoted to supplying even the most discerning pet owners with a wide assortment of curated pet food, including organic and veterinary prescription diets. We also stock environmentally-friendly toys, training tools, treats, and grooming products. We carefully monitor pet food recalls and supply only the highest-grade goods. You can be certain, if it’s Pet Friends approved, it’s safe!

                        Skin-related issues are not limited to human beings and can plague animals too. Much like their owners, pets should also have regular visits to the dermatologist. Like us, pets can suffer from skin rashes, allergies, infections and other related issues, which can be aggravated by the hot climatic conditions. Since animals spend most of their time walking and lying down on the ground, their skin is more prone to contracting infections and to being aggravated. Skin conditions in pets should not be taken lightly because of the possibility of the disease being transmissible to you. Pet health can be beneficial to the overall health of your household. Our veterinary dermatologists are highly trained in treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in pets.

                        Vaccination is the process of immunization, which enhances an animal’s immune system and helps it fight diseases. Vaccines are made from killed or weakened forms of bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms that cause disease in dogs.
