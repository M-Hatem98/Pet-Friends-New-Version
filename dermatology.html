              <p>Skin problems are not exclusive to humans; animals can also be affected. Just like us, pets should have regular check-ups with a dermatologist. They can suffer from skin rashes, allergies, infections, and other issues, especially in hot weather. Since animals spend a lot of time on the ground, their skin is more susceptible to infections. It's important to take skin conditions in pets seriously, as some diseases can be passed on to humans. Taking care of your pet's skin can also benefit the health of your entire household. Our veterinary dermatologists are experts in treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in pets.</p>

              <h3>FAQs</h3>
              <h4>How can skin disease in dogs be treated?</h4>
              <p>When it comes to treating skin disease in dogs, the first step is to address the infection. Antibiotics are typically used to eliminate any bacteria that may be causing the issue, while antifungal medication can help prevent the growth of fungus. Additionally, antiseptic washes and corticosteroids may be utilized to reduce inflammation in the affected area. Deworming is also recommended as it has been shown to have a positive impact on cases of canine acne and other dermatological issues in animals.</p>
              <p>For the best pet dermatology treatments in Dubai, consider seeking out dedicated professionals who offer top-quality care for your beloved furry companions.</p>
              <h4>How can I determine if my dog is suffering from a fungal or bacterial infection?</h4>
              <p>If you are unsure about whether your dog has a fungal infection, there are some signs to look out for:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>White or yellowish-white patches on the skin</li>
                <li>Thick, rough skin that resembles a piece of bark attached to the dog's body, which can be caused by fleas and ticks.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you observe these symptoms in your pet and they do not improve within a few days, it is important to contact the veterinarian immediately. Fungal infections are common in dogs, but not all pets are affected by them. It can be challenging for owners to recognize when something is wrong, as there may not be any noticeable changes in their pet's appearance or behavior, and sometimes even their personality.</p>
              <h3>How did my dog contract a bacterial skin infection?</h3>
              <p>Bacterial skin infections in dogs are commonly caused by bites or scratches and can be transmitted through the air, contaminated water, or contact with other animals. If a bacterial infection has developed, it is crucial to prevent the spread of bacteria, alleviate pain, and promote healing in the affected area.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it is important to be aware of the necessary steps to take if your dog has been exposed to an infection before receiving treatment. This way, you can avoid subjecting your dog to unnecessary stressors, such as having an uncomfortable bandage on their face for an extended period until they recover.</p>

Some signs of poor dental care include bad breath, gum disease, and tooth loss. Dental care for dogs and cats at home is essential to keep your pet happy and healthy.

                            FOOD DELIVERY Feeding your pets high quality food gives them a chance at a longer and healthier life. Like humans, pets also require essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Poor nutrition can have serious effects like obesity, allergies, fur loss, and emaciation. Unbalanced diets, especially during your pets’ growing phase, can result in detrimental health consequences. Indicators for poor nutrition you should look out for include bad breath, hair loss, dull coat, body odor, unusual bowel movements, and dandruff. At the Pet Friends we understand that cats and dogs are more than just pets, they are family. That is why we are devoted to supplying even the most discerning pet owners with a wide assortment of curated pet food, including organic and veterinary prescription diets. We also stock environmentally-friendly toys, training tools, treats, and grooming products. We carefully monitor pet food recalls and supply only the highest-grade goods. You can be certain, if it’s Pet Friends approved, it’s safe!

                            Skin-related issues are not limited to human beings and can plague animals too. Much like their owners, pets should also have regular visits to the dermatologist. Like us, pets can suffer from skin rashes, allergies, infections and other related issues, which can be aggravated by the hot climatic conditions. Since animals spend most of their time walking and lying down on the ground, their skin is more prone to contracting infections and to being aggravated. Skin conditions in pets should not be taken lightly because of the possibility of the disease being transmissible to you. Pet health can be beneficial to the overall health of your household. Our veterinary dermatologists are highly trained in treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in pets.
