                    <p>Cats are among the most beloved pets globally. They are simple to look after, affordable to own, and provide a great deal of love in return. Nevertheless, failing to spay or neuter your cat can lead to high expenses. To address this issue, animal shelters and rescue organizations often provide discounted spay/neuter services for individuals who adopt cats or kittens from them.</p>
                    <h3>What Is Cat Spaying/Neutering?</h3>
                    <p>Spaying and neutering are surgical procedures carried out on cats to prevent reproduction. Spaying involves the removal of the female reproductive organs, such as the ovaries and uterus, while neutering involves removing either both testicles (in males) or just one testicle (in females). These procedures are typically performed by a veterinarian, who will also provide information on the surgical process.</p>
                    <h3>Why Spay/neuter a cat?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To prevent overpopulation</li>
                        <li>To decrease the risk of certain cancers, such as uterine and mammary tumors</li>
                        <li>To avoid unwanted litters</li>
                        <li>To prevent aggression between cats that can lead to injuries or even death</li>
                        <li>To reduce roaming behavior and territorial fights between male cats</li>
                        <li>To prevent spraying, a common behavior in male cats.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>When To Neuter A Cat?</h3>
                    <p>Neutering a cat is a good idea if you want to prevent unwanted litters, prevent cat spraying, prevent aggression and reduce the chance that your cat will be obese. Neutering also helps keep your pet from developing diabetes or hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid). If you’re thinking about spaying or neutering your cat, make sure you do it at least six months after she is born so that her hormones aren’t affected by pregnancy hormones.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What Are the Side Effects of Neutering Male Cats?</h3>
                    <p>The side effects commonly observed after neutering male cats include pain, swelling, and lethargy. Your cat may exhibit signs of irritability or grumpiness due to the pain medications administered to manage his discomfort. In cases where your cat develops a urinary tract infection (UTI), there may be mild bleeding from the penis area, along with symptoms such as fever and lethargy.</p>
                    <p>If you have concerns about the potential side effects of neutering your male cat, here are a few factors to take into account:</p>
                    <h3>What Are the Side Effects of Neutering Male Cats?</h3>
                    <p>Neutering male cats has several benefits, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decreasing the likelihood of testicular cancer. Neutering reduces the risk of testicular cancer in male cats by approximately 90 percent.</li>
                        <li> Lowering the risk of prostate cancer in older males. Neutering also decreases the chances of older male cats developing prostate cancer, especially those over ten years old or with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).</li>
                        <li>Reducing the occurrence of mammary tumors in female dogs and cats (mammary carcinomas). Neutering at any age can decrease the likelihood of this type of tumor by up to 80 percent!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Why should a cat not be neutered?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Neutering should be avoided if the cat is in poor health or has a tumor.</li>
                        <li>If the cat has a heart murmur and there are concerns about possible complications, it may be advisable to delay the surgery for the time being.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>FAQs</h3>
                    <h4>For how much time will my cat be staying at the hospital? </h4>
                    <p>Certain hospitals opt to keep surgical patients overnight to allow them to rest in a suitable restricted setting. Some veterinarians believe that this initial night of confinement assists in the healing of the incision. On the other hand, some hospitals and the majority of spay clinics discharge the cat on the same day as the surgery, enabling her to be monitored at home in case any complications arise. Both approaches are acceptable and mainly depend on the preference and philosophy of the physician in charge of establishing the policy.</p>
                    <h4>Will spaying affect her personality?</h4>
                    <p>For at least half of the year, a female cat's reproductive system is not active, as cats only go through cycles seasonally, mainly in the spring and summer. This means that most of the time she behaves as if she is already spayed, so there should be no noticeable change in her personality. However, it is important to note that a cat in heat can be very affectionate. This playful and flirtatious behavior will stop after spaying.</p>
                    <h4>When should you neuter a cat?</h4>
                    <p> It is recommended to have your cat spayed or neutered as early as possible. However, there are instances where it may be considered too late. If you have an older cat that has lost weight and is in good health but still displays signs of being in heat, it may be advisable to wait until her heat cycle has ended before proceeding with the spaying or neutering procedure.</p>
                    <h4>How Long After Neutering Does Behavior Change, Cat?</h4>
                    <p>Many factors can affect your cat’s behavior. Some cats will be more mellow after neutering, while others may be more active and vocal.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to note that not all cats change in these ways after surgery; some remain the same as before their operation.</p>
                    <h4>How Long Does It Take To Recover From Neutering A Cat?</h4>
                    <p>Cats usually return to normal within a few days and can be ready for play again by the end of the first week. They may be sore for a few days, but they’ll be fine once they heal.</p>
                    <p>Cats will also likely become more affectionate and playful after neutering or spaying, so you must take your cat in as soon as possible if you want them to return to its normal behavior!</p>
                    <p>If your cat has been neutered, it may also become less aggressive towards other animals (including other cats). This can help reduce territorial disputes between domestic pets who live together under one roof—and even help prevent some types of dog aggression against humans!</p>
                    <h4>Does neutering a cat calm them down?</h4>
                    <p>Neutering a cat does not calm them down. Neutering can make your cat more affectionate and friendly towards strangers. It also makes them less likely to mark their territory – a behavior usually associated with fear or anxiety about people (they might be trying to protect themselves).</p>
                    <p>This isn’t to say that all neutered cats are calmer than unneutered ones – there are still plenty of cats who have been fixed in the past, showing signs of aggression when they’re around other animals or humans! But on average, it seems like neutering helps calm some behaviors down.</p>

                            FOOD DELIVERY Feeding your pets high quality food gives them a chance at a longer and healthier life. Like humans, pets also require essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Poor nutrition can have serious effects like obesity, allergies, fur loss, and emaciation. Unbalanced diets, especially during your pets’ growing phase, can result in detrimental health consequences. Indicators for poor nutrition you should look out for include bad breath, hair loss, dull coat, body odor, unusual bowel movements, and dandruff. At the Pet Friends we understand that cats and dogs are more than just pets, they are family. That is why we are devoted to supplying even the most discerning pet owners with a wide assortment of curated pet food, including organic and veterinary prescription diets. We also stock environmentally-friendly toys, training tools, treats, and grooming products. We carefully monitor pet food recalls and supply only the highest-grade goods. You can be certain, if it’s Pet Friends approved, it’s safe!

                            Skin-related issues are not limited to human beings and can plague animals too. Much like their owners, pets should also have regular visits to the dermatologist. Like us, pets can suffer from skin rashes, allergies, infections and other related issues, which can be aggravated by the hot climatic conditions. Since animals spend most of their time walking and lying down on the ground, their skin is more prone to contracting infections and to being aggravated. Skin conditions in pets should not be taken lightly because of the possibility of the disease being transmissible to you. Pet health can be beneficial to the overall health of your household. Our veterinary dermatologists are highly trained in treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in pets.
