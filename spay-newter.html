                <p>At Pet Friends, we understand the importance of your pet's health and well-being. Our clinic takes pride in offering specialized sterilization and neutering services, designed to provide the best care for your beloved pets. With a focus on safety, comfort, and recovery, our experienced veterinary team uses the latest technologies and compassionate care. By choosing Pet Friends for your pet's sterilization and neutering needs, you are ensuring a healthier and happier life for your furry family members. Trust us to be your partner in owning a responsible pet.</p>
                <h3>What is the sterilization process in pets?</h3>
                <p>Sterilization is a process used by veterinarians to permanently prevent reproduction in pets. Sterilization can be done through surgical procedures, or it can be done using medications that are injected into the animal's bloodstream. In both cases, sterilization prevents future pregnancies and the birth of offspring in your pet's body. This can help protect you and others living with your pet from unwanted litters.</p>
                <p>If you have a dog or cat with young puppies or kittens at home, they should be sterilized before they reach sexual maturity, so they don't have more offspring!</p>
                <h3>Sterilizing pets has many benefits for their health.</h3>
                <h3>Spaying or neutering your pet will not cause weight gain.</h3>
                <p>Pets, just like humans, can become overweight due to similar reasons. Lack of exercise and excessive eating are the main culprits. To keep a pet in good shape and health, it is important to ensure they get enough physical activity and eat a balanced diet in appropriate portions.</p>
                
                <h3>Prolonging the life of your female pet can be achieved by spaying her.</h3>
                <p>By spaying your kitten between the ages of 3 and 6 months, you can greatly reduce her chances of developing mammary cancer in adulthood. Additionally, spaying your cat provides protection against various uterine and ovarian diseases and cancers.</p>
                <p>According to a study involving 460,000 cats and 2.2 million dogs, spayed cats live 39% longer, while spayed dogs live 23% longer compared to their unaltered counterparts. Similar to cats, spayed dogs also have a decreased risk of developing certain cancers and pyometra, which is a potentially fatal uterine infection.</p>
                
                <h3>Sterilized animals feel happy at home.</h3>
                <p>One of the reasons that sterilized cats live longer is that they are less likely to leave the house and fight with other male cats. Sterilization inhibits the production of testosterone. This hormone is responsible for aggression.</p>
                <p>The same applies to sterilized dogs. They are less likely to wander in search of a mate and be hit by a car or fight with another dog during that time.</p>
                
                <h3>The impact of pet sterilization on behavior.</h3>
                <h3>Spayed animals do not go into heat.</h3>
                <p>When your female pet is spayed, she will not experience estrus. Female cats usually go into heat for about four to five days every three weeks during the breeding season. They may yowl and urinate more often to attract a mate, sometimes even inside the house.</p>
                
                <h3>A male dog refuses to leave the house.</h3>
                <p>Your male dog is less likely to wander away from home. A male dog that has not been neutered will go to great lengths to find a mate, even coming up with clever ways to escape. Allowing him to roam freely puts him at risk of getting hurt in traffic or getting into fights with other animals.</p>
                
                <h3>Pets that have been neutered tend to exhibit better behavior.</h3>
                <p>Neutering your male pet can lead to improved behavior. Unaltered dogs and cats tend to spray pungent urine around the house to establish their territory. However, after undergoing the neutering procedure, your dog is less likely to exhibit mounting behavior towards other animals, humans, or inanimate objects. Additionally, early spaying and neutering can help prevent certain aggression problems.</p>
                
                <h3>Сat Sterilization</h3>
                <p>Cat sterilization is a crucial aspect of responsible pet ownership, particularly in Dubai where the population of feral and domestic cats is significant. This process, which includes both neutering (for male cats) and spaying (for female cats), helps in controlling the cat population and reducing the number of homeless cats. In Dubai, cat neutering and cat castration refer to the surgical removal of a male cat’s testicles, which not only prevents unwanted breeding but also can lead to a reduction in aggressive behavior and the risk of certain diseases. Similarly, cat spaying, the surgical removal of a female cat’s reproductive organs, not only prevents unwanted litters but also reduces the risk of ovarian and mammary gland cancers. These procedures are widely advocated by veterinarians and animal welfare organizations in Dubai to ensure the health and well-being of cats, as well as to maintain a balanced urban animal population.</p>
                
                <h3>Dog Sterilization</h3>
                <p>Sterilizing dogs is a crucial step in responsible pet ownership, especially in a bustling city like Dubai. This process includes neutering for male dogs and spaying for females. Neutering involves removing a male dog's testicles, which helps control breeding, reduce aggression, and prevent certain health issues. In Dubai, where there are both pet dogs and strays, neutering is highly recommended to manage the population and promote animal welfare. Spaying, on the other hand, removes a female dog's reproductive organs to prevent unwanted litters and reduce the risk of diseases like mammary cancer. These sterilization procedures are strongly encouraged in Dubai to ensure the health and happiness of dogs, as well as maintain a balanced and compassionate urban animal community.</p>
                
                <h3>FAQs</h3>
                <h4>How much does it cost to neuter a cat?</h4>
                <p>Our clinic provides affordable pet sterilization services. The price for neutering (castration) a dog starts at 1600 AED, excluding VAT. This procedure is important for managing the dog population and enhancing your pet's health. Cat castration is also offered, with prices starting at 870 AED, excluding VAT. Spaying services for dogs start at 1800 AED and for cats at 1120 AED, both excluding VAT. These procedures are crucial for preventing unwanted litters and promoting the overall health of your pets.</p>
                
                <h4>How long does the procedure take?</h4>
                <p>The veterinarian will administer a local anesthetic to your pet's skin before starting the procedure. This injection is given to numb the area and typically takes around 30 minutes to complete. The procedure itself is performed under general anesthesia, ensuring that your pet does not feel any pain during or after the surgery.</p>
                <p>The entire sterilization process is carried out in a sterile environment to prevent any bacteria from contaminating the equipment used. This is particularly crucial for pets with allergies or other conditions that could lead to infections if proper precautions are not taken during their visit to our clinic!</p>
                
                <h4>Is there any associated pain?</h4>
                <p>There is no need to worry about the severity of the pain. It is usually mild and can be treated with pain relievers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol.</p>
                <p>If you are facing a large needle (vein), you may feel some discomfort as the needle enters your pet's body, but this should be temporary and will soon fade away.</p>
                
                <h4>Is it possible to have my pet spayed while she is pregnant?</h4>
                <p>Yes, it is possible for your veterinarian to perform a sterilization procedure on your pet while she is pregnant. This can be done at any stage of pregnancy and does not require anesthesia. The risks associated with the procedure are similar to those for non-pregnant animals. If you are unsure whether to proceed with the surgery or wait until after your pet gives birth, it is best to consult with your veterinarian for their recommendations on the best course of action in this situation.</p>
                
                <h4>Does Sterilization Affect My Pet's Behavior?</h4>
                <p>Surgical sterilization has a positive impact on reducing the number of offspring in a litter. This is beneficial for your pet as it ensures that more puppies and kittens are not born and separated from their mother. Moreover, spayed animals are less likely to wander and engage in fights with other animals or humans, which is particularly advantageous if you have young children at home.</p>
                <p>In addition, spaying helps prevent certain behaviors in cats, such as roaming and fighting with other cats or dogs. The same applies to male dogs that have been neutered at an early stage in life; they are less prone to displaying aggression towards other individuals or pets.</p>
                
                <h4>Do Castrated Animals Live Longer</h4>
                <p>Animals that undergo castration experience an extended lifespan. This is attributed to the decrease in testosterone levels, which can result in heightened aggression and an increased likelihood of prostate cancer. Furthermore, castration diminishes the chances of testicular cancer, mammary cancer, and uterine infection. Additionally, castrated males have a reduced risk of developing urinary tract infections (UTIs).</p>

                            FOOD DELIVERY Feeding your pets high quality food gives them a chance at a longer and healthier life. Like humans, pets also require essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Poor nutrition can have serious effects like obesity, allergies, fur loss, and emaciation. Unbalanced diets, especially during your pets’ growing phase, can result in detrimental health consequences. Indicators for poor nutrition you should look out for include bad breath, hair loss, dull coat, body odor, unusual bowel movements, and dandruff. At the Pet Friends we understand that cats and dogs are more than just pets, they are family. That is why we are devoted to supplying even the most discerning pet owners with a wide assortment of curated pet food, including organic and veterinary prescription diets. We also stock environmentally-friendly toys, training tools, treats, and grooming products. We carefully monitor pet food recalls and supply only the highest-grade goods. You can be certain, if it’s Pet Friends approved, it’s safe!

                            Skin-related issues are not limited to human beings and can plague animals too. Much like their owners, pets should also have regular visits to the dermatologist. Like us, pets can suffer from skin rashes, allergies, infections and other related issues, which can be aggravated by the hot climatic conditions. Since animals spend most of their time walking and lying down on the ground, their skin is more prone to contracting infections and to being aggravated. Skin conditions in pets should not be taken lightly because of the possibility of the disease being transmissible to you. Pet health can be beneficial to the overall health of your household. Our veterinary dermatologists are highly trained in treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in pets.
